make me simple app using html, tailwind, js and uses it libs cdns.

main purpose is app to take notes, or do something persnal (one page only)
and notes supports texts and images(it compressed to sertain point)
notes is like figma canvas page. things free to move and large space and shortcuts same as figma

now here is twist. the text support md format. and cant rotate but resozeble annd image too rezible and paste derectly suport in btoh text image. furturistic look

and all data must be incrptedly stored in indexdb of broswer. and have encrpted with password import and export option. if imported the past data loss and new from file comes.
and export may ask which password to set and do it.

it need to extremly simple to make and code it but extremly inteligent without ai. INTELLIGENT ux ui EVERY STUFFS oragnied code files. everything

and not zooming like figma like cont + scroll up or dwn at spefic area kind fetures..

-> unfocus any elemnt only happens in some areas where lot of elemnt present or inbetween not everywhere
-> zoom in out should same as figma from cursor it self.
